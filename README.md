# test-project

**The Test**

Create an application using React that will allow a user to connect to GitHub API's and
allow the user to navigate the app which contains some features as itemised below.

We will assess your deliverable based on your code structure, cleanliness, readability, logical flow, visual design and speed.

Deliver the test as if it was a small application that is going to production - i.e. think wider than just raw code (i.e. testing, code quality etc).

All individuals have different strengths so be sure to choose the approach to problem solving that suite your strengths.

**Features:**

1)      As a User I would like to search github in order to view the available repositories for a given search term

2)      As a User I would like to select a particular repository in order to view more details of the selected repository

a.      URL, description, forks count, stargazers count, open issues count etc

3)      As a User I would like to link to the actual GitHub page where the repository is located in order to view the code in the repository

Optional:

4)      As a User I would like to view a list of all the current issues for a repository in order to view the backlog of issues

5)      As a User I would like to filter the list of issues between STATE = ["Open" or "Closed"] in order to look through the filtered list

6)      As a User I would like to view a PIE chart that displays the breakdown of issues for the repository (open vs closed) in order to visually see how well built and maintained the repository is



Additional Points and Notes:

- Implement the best design possible for the user interface
- You can use vanilla CSS, SASS or a framework (e.g. Material UI, Ant Design) to style your application.
- Our preference is TypeScript, but you can use ES6.  Write clearly and use best practises to write the application.
